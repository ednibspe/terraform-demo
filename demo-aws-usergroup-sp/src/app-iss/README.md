### About

A Google Maps API driven web page which plots the current International Space Station location] and updates in (near) realtime.

### Source

The location data is powered by the [Open Notify API](https://github.com/open-notify/Open-Notify-API), which in turn scrapes its data from the [NASA spaceflight realtime data feed](http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/sightings/SSapplications/Post/JavaSSOP/orbit/ISS/SVPOST.html).
